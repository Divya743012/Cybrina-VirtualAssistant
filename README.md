<body>  
    <section class="main">
        <div class="image-container">

        </div>
    </section>

    <script src="script.js"></script>

In this code:

1. The HTML structure includes a header, sections for project description and features, a link to the GitHub repository, and a footer.

2. The project's title and a brief tagline are displayed in the header.

3. The "About Cybrina" section provides an overview of your virtual assistant.

4. The "Key Features" section highlights the main functionalities of Cybrina.

5. The "GitHub Repository" section includes a link to your GitHub repository where users can access the project's source code.

You would need to create corresponding CSS (styles.css) and JavaScript (script.js) files to style the page and add interactivity as needed. Additionally, make sure to replace `"https://github.com/your-username/cybrina-virtual-assistant"` with the actual URL to your GitHub repository.

Feel free to customize this code further to match your project's branding and style.
